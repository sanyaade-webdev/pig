# pig

Acceptance test framework for applications written in [node.js](http://nodejs.org).

## About

Eventually meant to be used with [cucumber-js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), similar to [Capybara](https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara), it is currently a **crude and very incomplete** client for [webkit-server](https://github.com/tristandunn/webkit-server). It is not ready for any sort of use.
